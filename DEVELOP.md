## Developing on CycleDash

Dependencies:

1. Python 2.7
2. Postgres 9.3 (should work on 9.0+)
3. [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) &
   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)
4. [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) for workers


### Setting up CycleDash

```bash
virtualenv venv                    # Initialize a new virtual environment.
source venv/bin/activate           # Activate your virtual environment.
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Install python requirements into virtualenv
npm install                        # Install JS requirements
make initenv                       # Initialize environment file.
$EDITOR ENV.sh                     # Fill in values.
```


### Database

We use PostgreSQL as our datastore, with the schema described in `schema.sql`.

You can load the schema with `psql cycledash < schema.sql`, and you'll be good
to go.

On OS X, setting up and running psql might look like this:

```
brew install postgres
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
createdb cycledash
psql cycledash
psql cycledash < schema.sql
```


### Start CycleDash

To start the application server:

```bash
gulp prod
./run.sh
```

Start a worker to process the queue. Make sure RabbitMQ is up and running!

```
./worker.sh Bob # Or whatever you want to name your worker.
                # Say, RosieTheRiveter.
```

You can start more workers with `./worker.sh <name>` etc. *with a different
name*.


### JavaScript

You can iterate more quickly on JavaScript with the following:

```
npm install             # Installs all packages in package.json.
npm install gulp -g     # Make sure you have gulp installed.
gulp                    # Compile the JS and start the automatic compiler
                        # and live-reloader.
```

To regenerate the `bundled.js` file without using the live reloader, run:

```
gulp build
```

This will also minify the JS and not create a source map.

To update BioDalliance, run:

```
npm install
gulp dalliance
```

Run `gulp peg` to update the PEG.js generated grammar after modifying CQL.

Run `gulp prod` to update all of the above (BioDalliance, PEG.js grammar, etc.)


### Python

If `USE_RELOADER` is True in your ENV.sh, then you'll get automatic
code-reloading with the Flask server and JS/CSS reloading via livereload and
gulp's livereload plugin.

To test the workers locally, you'll need to install and run rabbitmq during
development. For example, on Mac OS X, you can do this via:

```bash
brew install rabbitmq
/usr/local/opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmq-server
```

### Config

(Edit the `ENV.sh` file, generated by `make initenv`).

Environment variables which must be exported--edit them in the ENV.sh file make
made for you.

```
export PORT=5000
export DATABASE_URI=postgres:///cycledash'
export CELERY_BACKEND='db+sqlite:///celery.db'
export CELERY_BROKER='amqp://localhost'
export WEBHDFS_USER=username
export WEBHDFS_URL=http://example.com:5000
export TYPEKIT_URL="yourtypekitURLwithfontsincluded"
```


## Testing

CycleDash uses [nosetests](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for Python
tests, and [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) for JavaScript testing.

To run tests:

```
source path/to/bin/activate
source ./tests/ENV.sh    # make sure all our environment variables are around
nosetests tests/python   # Run Python tests
npm test                 # Run JS tests
```

To run an individual JavaScript test, you can use:

```
./node_modules/.bin/mocha --require mocha-clean --compilers .:tests/js/preprocessor.js path/to/test.js [--grep <regex>]
```

#### Perceptual Diff Testing

CycleDash uses [seltest](https://github.com/ihodes/seltest) for perceptual
difference testing. This means the tests operate an actual web browser and take
screenshots of the web-app being used. To update the reference screenshots, run:

```
source path/to/bin/activate
./tests/pdifftests/run.sh
```

Running `git status` after this should indicate whether the screenshots have
changed.

You can pass command-line options to `seltest` through `run.sh`,
e.g. `./tests/pdifftests/run.sh -d chrome` to run with the Chrome driver, or
`./tests/pdifftests/run.sh -c examine -f base` to filter the tests to those in
the 'examine' class with 'base' in their name.

To determine whether there are any pixels that have changed before/after, and to
generate a perceptual diff that will make it clear where the changes are, you
can use [webdiff](https://github.com/danvk/webdiff): `git webdiff`.
