    <p>
      Cycledash is an open-source somatic variant caller analysis and
      visualization tool. The
      <a href="https://github.com/hammerlab/cycledash">source can be found</a>
      on GitHub, and is developed by the
      <a href="http://hammerlab.org">Hammerlab</a> out of Mount Sinai's Icahn
      School of Medicine.

    <h3>JSON API</h3>
    <p>The primary endpoint for posting data to from an external source is <tt>/runs.</tt></p>

    <p>JSON should be POSTed to <tt>/runs</tt> with following fields:</p>

    <h4>Required</h4>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>vcfPath</dt>
      <dd>
        The path on HDFS where the VCF can be found.
        (e.g. <tt>/users/cycledasher/pt-123.vcf</tt>)
        This should be immutable, as CycleDash expects
        to be able to find the VCF here at any time.
      </dd>
      <dt>variantCallerName</dt>
      <dd>
        The name of the variant caller which produced this VCF. This
        should remain constrant between VCFs with the same caller in
        order to compare runs to one another.
      </dd>
      <dt>dataset</dt>
      <dd>
        The name of the dataset on which the caller was run (e.g. PT123).
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Optional</h4>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>truthVcfPath</dt>
      <dd>The path on HDFS for the truth (or "reference") VCF. This should be immutable.</dd>

      <dt>tumorPath</dt>
      <dd>The path on HDFS of the tumor BAM on which the caller was run.</dd>

      <dt>normalPath</dt>
      <dd>The path on HDFS of the normalBAM on which the caller was run.</dd>

      <dt>params</dt>
      <dd>Params that the caller was run with, or other notes relevant to the run.</dd>
    </dl>
